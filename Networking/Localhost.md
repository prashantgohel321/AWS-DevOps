What is localhost?
==================

“localhost” is not just some made-up programmer term. It’s an actual **reserved keyword** that always points to **your own computer**. Think of it like your computer’s **home address** in the digital world.

🤔 So What Happens When You Type localhost in a Browser?
--------------------------------------------------------

Let’s compare:When you type google.com, your computer asks a **DNS (Domain Name System)** to translate that name into an IP address, like 142.250.182.206, which is one of Google’s servers. Your request travels across the internet to reach Google.

But...When you type localhost, your computer doesn’t bother asking DNS. It already knows what to do. 👉 It skips all that and directly points **back to itself**. That’s why it’s called **“local” host** — because it's all happening on your own device.

💡 Localhost = 127.0.0.1
------------------------

Under the hood, localhost is just a nickname for the IP address 127.0.0.1.

*   On **Windows**, open this file:C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts
    
*   On **Linux/Mac**, open:/etc/hosts
    

Inside, you’ll see a line like this:127.0.0.1 localhost

This means your computer is told: “Hey, if someone types localhost, just treat it like 127.0.0.1.”

🔄 What is 127.0.0.1 and the Loopback Interface?
------------------------------------------------

The IP 127.0.0.1 is a **special address** that tells your computer: “Send this request to **yourself**.” You’re basically **talking to yourself**, digitally. 🤝

This is done via something called the **loopback interface** — a virtual network device that doesn’t connect to the internet or anything outside. It just loops traffic back to your machine.

✅ **Analogy:** It’s like bouncing a ball off a wall — it goes out and comes right back.

Also, not just 127.0.0.1, but the entire range from 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255 is reserved for loopback. Though, we almost always just use 127.0.0.1.

🛠 Can We Change the Name?
--------------------------

Yes, absolutely!You can **assign any custom name** to 127.0.0.1 in your host’s file. For example:127.0.0.1 localhost prashant mytestsite devserver

Now typing prashant or devserver in the browser (on your machine) will behave the same as localhost.

Why Is Localhost Useful?
------------------------

1.  **Testing & Development**You can build and test websites or APIs locally — no internet required.**Example:**
    
    *   Run a local server (like Apache, Nginx, Node.js)
        
    *   Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your app
        
2.  **Security**Requests to localhost never leave your machine, making it great for safe testing.
    
3.  **Speed**It’s super-fast since nothing travels across the internet.
