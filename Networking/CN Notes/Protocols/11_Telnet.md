# 🖥️ Telnet – The Old-School Remote Access Protocol
- A walkie-talkie from the early internet days

## 🔍 What is Telnet?
- Telnet is a network protocol that allows you **to remotely access and control devices over a network through a command-line interface (CLI)**.

- Think of it as a way to log in to another machine and type commands, just like you're sitting in front of it — but remotely.

## 🚧 Why Is It Outdated?
- 🛑 No encryption — all data, including usernames and passwords, is sent in plain text

- 🎯 Easy target for hackers (man-in-the-middle attacks)

- 🔒 Replaced by SSH (Secure Shell) — which does the same job but securely

---

<br>

## 🧪 How Telnet Works
- You open a Telnet client

- Connect to a device by its IP address and port (default: port 23)

- Type commands on your local machine

- Those commands are executed on the remote system

## 🧰 Where Telnet is (Still) Used
Testing open ports:
- E.g., check if port 80 or 25 is reachable from your system

```bash
telnet google.com 80
```
- Legacy networking equipment (old routers, switches)

- Private lab setups (where encryption isn’t a concern)

## 📚 DevOps Tip
Even though Telnet is insecure, it’s still useful as a quick test tool when:

- Debugging service ports

- Checking firewall rules

- Validating network connectivity

- But for actual access, always prefer SSH.

## ⚙️ Telnet vs SSH
| Feature        | Telnet                 | SSH                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Security       | ❌ Unencrypted          | ✅ Encrypted                   |
| Port           | 23                     | 22                            |
| Use Today      | 🔍 Testing only (rare) | 🛠️ Standard for remote admin |
| Protocol Layer | Application Layer      | Application Layer             |

## ✅ Final Summary
| Telnet Key Points                             |
| --------------------------------------------- |
| Remote command-line access protocol           |
| Sends data in **plain text** (⚠️ insecure)    |
| Default port: **23**                          |
| Replaced by **SSH** in modern systems         |
| Still useful for **quick connectivity tests** |

## 💡 Final Thought:
- Telnet was the first way we talked to remote machines, but today, it's like sending a password on a postcard — visible to anyone who intercepts it.

- Stick with SSH for secure access, but don’t forget Telnet’s testing value!
