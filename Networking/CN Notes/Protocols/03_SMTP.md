# 📧 SMTP – The Protocol That Sends Your Emails
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

## 📨 What is SMTP?
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol **for sending emails over the internet**.

- Whether you’re using Gmail, Outlook, or a custom mail server — behind the scenes, it’s SMTP doing the job of sending your message to the right person.

## 🔁 How SMTP Works (In Simple Terms)
SMTP is **a push protocol** — it pushes your email **from the sender’s client to the receiver’s mail server**.

> Think of it like sending a letter through a post office.

🧠 The flow looks like this:

```markdown
Your Mail Client (e.g., Gmail app)
         ⬇
      SMTP Server
         ⬇
Receiver’s Mail Server (e.g., Yahoo)
         ⬇
    Receiver’s Mailbox
```

## 🧩 SMTP Only Sends — It Doesn’t Receive!
So while SMTP handles outgoing email, it doesn’t deal with reading or fetching inbox messages.

That’s where POP3 and IMAP come in:
| Protocol | Purpose                | Common Use           |
| -------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| **SMTP** | Sends email (outbound) | Gmail → Friend       |
| **POP3** | Downloads email        | Inbox to device      |
| **IMAP** | Syncs email (cloud)    | Gmail across devices |

### 📬 In short:

- SMTP = 📤 Send

- IMAP/POP = 📥 Receive

## 🛡️ Is SMTP Secure?
- Not by default!

Basic SMTP transmits emails in plain text, which means:

- Anyone sniffing the traffic can read your emails

- Your login credentials are exposed without encryption


✅ To solve this, we use SMTPS (Secure SMTP):

- Works over SSL/TLS

- Ensures end-to-end encryption

- Protects emails in transit

## 🔢 SMTP Common Ports
| Port | Usage                            |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| 25   | Default SMTP (often blocked)     |
| 587  | SMTP with STARTTLS (recommended) |
| 465  | SMTP over SSL (legacy)           |

> 📌 In production, 587 is the go-to for sending secure emails.

## 🔧 SMTP in DevOps or Server Context?
If you ever host:

- Contact forms

- Alerting systems

- CI/CD notifications

- Cronjob reports

You’ll configure SMTP to send outgoing emails from your app or server.

E.g., sending alerts from a Linux server:

```bash
mail -s "Alert: High CPU Usage" you@example.com
```
The backend uses SMTP to push that email out.
