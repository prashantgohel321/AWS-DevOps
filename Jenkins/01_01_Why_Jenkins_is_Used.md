# Why jenkins is used?

Jenkins is used **to automate the entire software development process**, especially when working with Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). Normally, when a developer writes code and pushes it to a repository like GitHub, someone has to manually build the project, test it, and deploy it to a server. This is **time-consuming and error-prone**.

Jenkins solves this by automating all these steps. Once Jenkins is set up, it can automatically detect when new code is pushed. It then **builds the project**, **runs tests**, and if everything works fine, it **can even deploy the application to a live environment**.

The main reason Jenkins is so popular is because it helps teams move faster. Developers can focus on writing code, and **Jenkins handles everything after the code is pushed** — **from testing to deployment**. This reduces manual effort, speeds up the development process, and makes it easier to catch and fix bugs early.

Another key reason Jenkins is widely used is **because of its plugin system**. Jenkins supports thousands of plugins that allow it to integrate with almost any tool — like GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Slack, etc. This makes Jenkins flexible and usable in almost any DevOps workflow.

It **also supports all major programming languages and operating systems**, and it can run on local machines, virtual machines, or inside containers. This makes Jenkins adaptable for any team size or project type.

So, in simple words: Jenkins automates build, test, and deployment processes to help DevOps teams deliver software faster, more reliably, and with less manual effort.
