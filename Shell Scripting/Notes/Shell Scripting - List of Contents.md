# Shell Scripting

## 1. Introduction to Shell and Environment
- What is Shell? (Bash, Zsh, Ksh, etc.)
- Shell vs. Terminal vs. Bash
- Installing and Setting Up Bash (Linux on AWS EC2)

## 2. Basic Scripting Skills
- Writing your first shell script (.sh file, shebang, #!/bin/bash)
- Executing Scripts (chmod +x script.sh, ./script.sh, bash script.sh)
- Variables and Data Types (String, Integer, Arrays)
- Reading user input (read command)
- Basic Operators (Arithmentic, Relational, Logical)
- Control Flow:
	- Conditional Statements (if-else, case)
	- Looping (for, while, until)
- Functions in Shell Scripts
- Exit codes and status ($?, exit, command)

## 3. Intermediate Scripting Techniques
- Working with files and directories (ls, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, find)
- String manipulation (sed, awk, cut, tr)
- File permissions and ownership (chmod, chown, umask)
- Input and Output Redirection (>, >>, <, 2>, &>)
- Process Management (ps, top, kill, nohup, &, jobs, fg, bg)
- Cron Jobs and Task Automation (crontab -e, at, systemd timers)
- Working with logs (tail -f, grep, awk for parsing logs)

## 4. Advanced Scripting and Debugging
- Writing robust scripts with error handling (set -e, trap, ||, &&)
- Debugging techniques (bash -x script.sh, set -x, set -v)
- Regular Expressions and Pattern Matching )grep -E, sed -r)
- Advanced File Processing (awk, sed, xargs, cut, paste)
- Networking with Shell Scripts (pint, curl, wget, netstat, ss)
- Parallel Execution and Backgroun Jobs (&, wait, xargs -P)
- Working with APIs in Shell Scripts (cURL for REST API calls)

## 5. Real World Applications and Projects
- Automating AWS Operations (aws-cli)
- Backup and Restore Automation
- Log Parsing and Analysis with Shell Scripting
