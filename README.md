*   Troubleshooting common scenarios
    
*   Best practices for solution design
    

Linux
-----

This directory holds my in-depth notes on various Linux topics, structured by daily learning and specific concepts:

*   **Linux\_Day01.md**: Covers Linux fundamentals, including internet workings, server types, application classifications, Linux architecture (Kernel, Bootloader, Shell), file system hierarchy, and process states.
    
*   **Linux\_Day02.md**: Focuses on essential Linux commands for navigation, file/directory management, viewing/writing files, advanced utilities (cp, mv, wc, ln, cut, tee, sort, diff, vi), SSH, disk usage, and process management.
    
*   **Linux\_Day03.md**: Details Linux system-level commands, user/group management, and file permissions. Topics include uname, uptime, date, who, sudo, shutdown, package managers, chmod/chown, umask, compression, and file transfer (scp, rsync).
    
*   **Linux\_Day04.md**: Explores Linux networking commands crucial for troubleshooting, such as ping, netstat, ifconfig, traceroute, nslookup, telnet, hostname, ip address show, dig, whois, nc, arp, curl, wget, iptables, watch, nmap, and route.
    
*   **Linux\_Day05.md**: Provides detailed explanations and DevOps use cases for powerful text-processing tools: awk, sed, and grep, including a comparison of their strengths.
    
*   **Linux\_Volume\_Management.md**: An in-depth guide to Linux volume management, covering AWS EBS integration, hands-on volume creation/attachment to EC2, and Logical Volume Management (LVM) with Physical Volumes (PVs), Volume Groups (VGs), and Logical Volumes (LVs).
    

Networking

Shell Scripting
---------------

This directory contains notes and various shell scripts I've developed and practiced, ranging from basic automation tasks to more complex system utilities. Each script is typically commented to explain its purpose and functionality.

**Basic Scripts 1-10:**

*   `First\_Program01.sh`: A simple "Hello World" script.
    
*   `Program02.sh`: Take input from user and add those 2 numbers
    
*   `Program03.sh`: Take one number from user and check that number is even or odd, and then display message accordingly.
    
*   `Program04.sh`: Take three numbers from user and find largest out of three and print message.
    
*   `Program05.sh`: Take one number from user and print multiplication table of given number.
    
*   `Program06.sh`: Calculate Factorial
    
*   `Program07.sh`: Check whether given string is palindrome or not
    
*   `Program08.sh`: Print Fibonacci Series
    
*   `Program09.sh`: Check whether given number is prime or not.
